# Advent of Code 2024

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an advent calendar containing programming puzzles everyday through advent. Made by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/).

This repo contains my solutions to the various challenges. They are all written in Go, and these issues are used for me as a tool to learn the language. This is my first time working with Go, so the solutions are not intended to be the quickest or most elegant, but to solve the problem.

All solutions can be run with `go run` file.go. But do note they have to be run from the top of the repo. e.g. `$ .\2024\scripts\day1.go`

Note my personal challenge data is not included in this repo, only the samples from the challenges are included.
